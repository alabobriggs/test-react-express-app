# test-react-express-app

The project was created to test how create-react-app and an express server can run on one server.
This was beacuse of a confusion I had as I used firebase for my major react project https://github.com/alabobriggs/Burger-app so I didn't understand fully how to integrate a local backend with create-react-app
